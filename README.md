# Flight-Price-Prediction-with-linear-regression-
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of airline tickets. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, you aim to create a model that can learn from historical flight data and make predictions on new, unseen data.
